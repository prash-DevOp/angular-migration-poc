# AngularJS to Angular Migration

## Overview
This project documents the step-by-step process of migrating an AngularJS application to Angular, leveraging a hybrid approach. By setting up a hybrid environment, we enable progressive migration, ensuring functionality is preserved throughout the process.

---

## Steps Completed

### Step 1: Set Up the AngularJS App
#### What We Did:
- Created a basic AngularJS app (`pocApp`) with a simple list and detail view.
- Defined the AngularJS module and controller in `app.js`.
- Verified functionality in a standalone AngularJS setup.

#### Importance:
- Established the foundation for the migration process.
- Ensured there is a working AngularJS app to progressively migrate to Angular.

#### Alignment with Migration Guides:
- Matches the initial step in the PhoneCat tutorial to prepare the AngularJS application as the starting point for migration.

---

### Step 2: Set Up the Angular Project
#### What We Did:
- Created a new Angular project using Angular CLI.
- Installed the `@angular/upgrade` package to enable hybrid integration.
- Organized the project structure for seamless integration.

#### Importance:
- Set up the Angular environment to serve as the migration target.
- Prepared the app for the hybrid approach, where AngularJS and Angular coexist.

#### Alignment with Migration Guides:
- Mirrors the step where the Angular workspace is created to integrate with the existing AngularJS application.

---

### Step 3: Hybrid Integration (AngularJS + Angular)
#### What We Did:
- Updated `main.ts` to bootstrap both Angular and AngularJS using `UpgradeModule`.
- Linked AngularJS (`angular.min.js`) and `app.js` in `index.html`.
- Resolved issues related to file loading, static file serving, and module initialization.

#### Importance:
- Enabled AngularJS and Angular to run together in the same application.
- Formed the core of the hybrid approach, allowing progressive migration without breaking functionality.

#### Alignment with Migration Guides:
- Matches the "Bootstrapping a Hybrid Application" section by configuring `UpgradeModule` for dual-framework operation.

---

### Step 4: Migrate One AngularJS Component to Angular
#### What We Did:
- Created an Angular `ItemListComponent` to replace the AngularJS list component.
- Used `downgradeComponent` to make the Angular component usable in AngularJS templates.
- Resolved conflicts in hybrid bootstrapping.

#### Importance:
- Demonstrates a successful component migration while maintaining hybrid functionality.
- Shows how to use Angular components in AngularJS templates, paving the way for further migration

#### Alignment with Migration Guides:
- Reflects the "Upgrade AngularJS Components" step, focusing on migrating components incrementally.

---

### Step 5: Migrate an AngularJS Service to Angular

#### What We Did:

- Migrated the `ItemService` from AngularJS to Angular.

- Recreated the service in Angular using `@Injectable`.

- Downgraded the Angular service using `downgradeInjectable` to make it accessible in AngularJS.

#### Importance:
- Demonstrates how to safely migrate services while ensuring compatibility in the hybrid app.

- Paves the way for migrating additional services without disrupting existing functionality.

#### Alignment with Migration Guides:
- Matches the "Migrating AngularJS Services" section by showing how to migrate services incrementally.

## How This Aligns with the Bigger Picture

### Incremental Migration:
- The hybrid environment enables the migration of components and services one step at a time, avoiding the risk of breaking the app by migrating everything at once.

### Progressive Replacement:
- Components and services are gradually replaced with Angular versions, ensuring functionality is preserved throughout the migration.

### Hybrid Approach Benefits:
- Allows developers to test Angular features in a controlled environment while still relying on existing AngularJS components.

## Steps Completed vs. Remaining

### Completed:
1. Set up the AngularJS app.
2. Set up the Angular project.
3. Configured hybrid integration.
4. Migrated one AngularJS component to Angular.
5. Migrated one AngularJS service to Angular.

### Remaining:
1. Finalize migration by removing AngularJS dependencies and testing.
